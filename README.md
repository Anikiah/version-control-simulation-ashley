# The steps to create and manage branches.

  1. Set up the Repository.
  2. Created feature/header branch.
  3. Made changes in the Feature branch. Staged and commit those changes.
  4. Switched back to the main branch.
  5. Create another branch called feature/footer.
  6. Added footer element to branch then stage and commit changes.
  7. Simulated a conflict.
  8. Resolved the conflict, then commit the resolved changes.
  9. Push Changes to GitHub.
  10. Created Pull Request.

# Handling Merge Conflict

  To resolve the conflict, I opened the conflicting file and made the correct change t the proper file. After making the file change, I merged the file and commited the change. 

# Pull Request Process

  I had an issue creating a pull request. I was unable to find the files local that I submitted to my repository. I was able to download the raw file of my README.md and the index.html but I had trouble figuring out how to go about saving them again to my github repository.
